## Main Steps

* Data Collection
* Data Modelling 
*  Deployment

  

## Data Modelling division

###  Problem Definition
#### Supervised
* Classification.
* Regression  ~~prediction~~
* Knowledge of the inputs and outputs.
#### Unsupervised
* Data without label.
* Clustering data.
#### Transfer
* Use machine learning models to create new machine learning model.
#### Reinforcement
* Task repetition.
* Increase the final result.
### Data (what kind of)
#### Structured
* Similar form to express data ~~database file~~
#### Unstructured
* Images, sound and videos
### Evaluation (definition of success)
### Features (what do we already know about)
* Know the variables to target a result.
* Numeric features.
* Categorical features.
* Only use features most present in the data ~~feature coverage~~.
### Modelling (based on our problem and data)
#### Choosing and training a model
* Normally use of 3 sets, training > validation > test.
	* take care of similar sets. 
 * Find a balance between accuracy and time(cost) of a model.
#### Turning a model
* Model variables adjust.
#### Model comparison
